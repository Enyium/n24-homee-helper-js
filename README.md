# `n24-homee-helper`

A command line program with a suite of commands to help sufferers of the [non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-24-hour_sleep%E2%80%93wake_disorder) who use [Homee](https://hom.ee/) as their home automation system and have set up homeegrams for their subjective-day phases. One s.-day phase homeegram is always running as an indicator of the phase currently applying.

Note that, in the [official Homee web app](https://my.hom.ee/), you can find the ID of a homeegram in its URL when [visiting its page](https://my.hom.ee/automations/homeegrams).

# Setup

```
npm install n24-homee-helper --global
```

Edit the config file (see help screen) to specify necessary details about your Homee, your sleep and your preferences.
